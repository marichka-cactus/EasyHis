EasyHis is the final course project accomplished By Marichka Zlatohurska within the Python for Beginners course
from Beetroot Academy.
It resolves the author's daily routine tasks (statistic processing and data visualisation).
EasyHis is designed with using Python 3.8 and such python libraries as PyQt5, matplotlib, numpy, scipy.
It takes a CSV format file as an input. The data should be arranged in single column without heading.
Outliers are eliminated from the data set using Inter Quartile Range method (https://kanoki.org/2020/04/23/how-to-remove-outliers-in-python/).
There are two options for data visualisation: the frequency distribution histogram and the box whiskers plot.
In the case of histogram the number of bins is 10 by default, but this parameter can be customized.
The output is the image in PNG format.

The easyhis_linux file can be launched from command line using script:
./easyhis_linux

Save your time and enjoy using EasyHis.
